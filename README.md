Hi 👋 I'm Onur, a marketer turned bootstrapper and a Ruby on Rails developer.

After two decades of doing marketing at agencies like [R/GA](https://rga.com) and MNCs such as [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/) and [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com), I've started teaching myself Ruby and building businesses on the internet.

Here are some of my recent projects:

- [Meet Lars](https://meetlars.com) - AI-powered marketing strategy and positioning tool
- [APAC Agencies](https://apacagencies.com) - Curated directory of top creative and digital agencies in Asia Pacific
- [Craft Tattoo](https://craft.tattoo) - AI tattoo design generator with multiple art styles
- [Forage](https://forage.sg) - Food and drink recipe blog without life stories, ads or trackers
