Hi 👋 I'm Onur, a marketer turned bootstrapper and a Ruby on Rails developer.

After two decades of doing marketing at agencies, startups and MNCs, I've started teaching myself Ruby and building businesses on the internet.

Here are some of my recent projects:

- [Craft Tattoo](https://craft.tattoo) - AI tattoo design generator with multiple art styles
